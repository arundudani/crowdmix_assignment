This project is created in IntelliJ. JDK Used is JDK 8 rev 31
In IntelliJ project settings, language level is set to 8

Other than standard JDK libraries, only org.junit is used for tests

To run the application, simply run CrowdMixMain as Java Application

The available commands are displayed as help on application startup.

The commands are exactly as per the pdf requirements. Only addition is the "quit" command to quit out of application

In case the command entered is wrong, the list of available commands is displayed again.

Lastly, once the application is started, it runs continually and waits for input (and of course processing
those commands) till quit command is entered
